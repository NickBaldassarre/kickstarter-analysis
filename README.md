# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to determine trends

In this analysis, data was taken from various Kickstarter campagains throughout the world in various fields. We filtered this data to zero in on theater productions in order to provide perspective in deciding how to best move forward with an upcoming Kickstarter campaign.

### Initial Findings

Trends began to emerge regarding times of year and campaign goals that yielded the highest levels of success. In the following chart, we can see that theater campaigns are the most popular in our data set. We can also see that a slight majority of theater campaigns are successful.

We can determine that theater campaigns have more than 50% of success, but we need to further understand what may contribute to success in order to better position our campaign to succeed. In the following line chart we look at launch dates for theater campaigns by month.

Here we can see that there is a trend towards success that spikes in May and declines through the year from there. It is important to keep in mind that there are significantly more theater campaigns overall in the summer months, but even with this in mind the data points towards an increased chance of success with a May launch date.

In addition to the above findings, we were able to determine that funding goals also played a part in the success rate. A funding goal of $3000 was most likely to yield a successful outcome.
